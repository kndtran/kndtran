Public code of my past work
-  Universal Propositions 2.0
   - https://universalpropositions.github.io/
   - https://aclanthology.org/2022.lrec-1.181/
   - Contributed the gold labels for the Vietnamese model (which generated the UP2.0 Vietnamese dataset) in collaboration with researchers from a Vietnamese university, using a labeling tool that I developed.
   - Delivered a BERT model fine-tuned to the SRL task to the Watson NLP library. A version of this model was used to generate the labels for the different languages in the UP2.0 repo.
- PriMe-SRL Eval
   - https://github.com/UniversalPropositions/PriMeSRL-Eval
   - https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06408
   - This work is the open sourcing of parts of our internal evaluation process for the SRL (Semantic Role Labeling) task. I developed the project structure, pipelines, tests, comparison and evaluation scripts, and various utility functions to glue everything together.
